# Quiz4Win — Host Logic

Last updated: 2026-06-17
Reference: INV-16, INV-17, INV-18 in `project-brain/Domain_Knowledge.md`

## 1. Overview

A **host** (`show_hosts` row) is a human presenter assigned to a `mode = 'live'` game. Hosts manage their own profile via `host.quiz4win.com`, which is backed by the `/host/*` Edge Function (`supabase/functions/host/index.ts`).

---

## 2. Host Lifecycle (Application → Active)

```
[no row]
   │  POST /host/apply
   ▼
application_status = 'pending'  (status = 'inactive')
   │  Admin approves in panel
   ▼
application_status = 'approved'  (status = 'active')
   │  Admin suspends
   ▼
application_status = 'suspended'  ─── read-only, no new writes
   │  Admin rejects
   ▼
application_status = 'rejected'  ─── terminal; host may re-apply → back to 'pending'
```

**Gates enforced by `requireApproved(host)`** (checked before every write action):
- `application_status === 'approved'`
- `status !== 'suspended'`

---

## 3. Game Visibility — `requires_host` Flag

Each `games` and `game_templates` row has:

| Column | Default | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `requires_host` | `TRUE` | When `FALSE`, the game is excluded from the host-app available list entirely (AI-run or automated shows). |

- **Available list** (`GET /host/games/available`) filters `.eq("requires_host", true)`.
- Admin controls the flag per-template (propagates to generated games) or per-game via the edit form.
- Existing games are unaffected (default `TRUE`).

---

## 4. Assignment Flows

There are three ways a host gets assigned to a game. Each lands on a different `host_assignment_status`:

### 4a. Host Self-Request (host initiates)
```
Host → POST /host/games/:id/request  →  host_game_requests row (status='pending')
Admin → approve in panel             →  claimGameHost()
                                         games.host_id = host.id
                                         games.host_assignment_status = 'accepted'
                                     →  Host sees: Start Hosting immediately
```
The host already opted in by requesting — no redundant accept step.

### 4b. Admin Direct Assignment (admin initiates)
```
Admin → edit-game or create-game form (HostPickerDialog)
      → updateGame() / createGame()
           games.host_id = host.id
           games.host_assignment_status = 'pending'
      → notifyHostAssigned() sends in-app + email
Host  → sees: Accept / Reject buttons
      → POST /host/games/:id/accept  → status = 'accepted'  → Start Hosting
      → POST /host/games/:id/reject  → host_id = NULL, status = 'unassigned', game back to pool
```

### 4c. Invitation (admin-sent formal invite — `host_invitations` table)
```
Admin → creates host_invitation row
Host  → GET /host/invitations
      → POST /host/invitations/:id/accept  (INV-17 conflict check runs here)
           games.host_id = host.id
           games.host_assignment_status = 'accepted'
      → POST /host/invitations/:id/reject
```

## 5. `host_assignment_status` State Machine

```
unassigned ──(admin assigns)──► pending ──(host accepts)──► accepted ──► [go live]
                                   │
                                   └──(host rejects)──► unassigned
```

| Value | Who sets it | Host CTA |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `unassigned` | Default / after rejection / admin unassigns | Game in pool (no host) |
| `pending` | Admin directly assigns | **Accept / Reject** |
| `accepted` | Host accepts, or request approved, or invitation accepted | **Start Hosting** |
| `rejected` | Host rejects (status immediately clears to `unassigned`) | — |

> **Note:** Games assigned before this feature shipped were backfilled to `'accepted'` by migration `20260617000000`. To test the accept/reject flow on such a game, unassign then re-assign the host.

---

## 6. Compensation — Fee & Commission

Each game carries:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `host_fee` | `NUMERIC(12,2)` | Fixed fee paid to host on game completion |
| `host_commission_pct` | `NUMERIC(5,2)` | % of total entry-fee income paid to host |
| `show_host_fee` | `BOOLEAN` | Admin toggle — reveal `host_fee` to host-app |
| `show_host_commission` | `BOOLEAN` | Admin toggle — reveal `host_commission_pct` to host-app |

`maskFeeFields()` (Edge Function) strips hidden fields before sending game data to the host-app.

**Payout trigger** (`trg_record_host_earning`): fires when `games.prizes_distributed_at` transitions `NULL → value`. Calls `record_host_earning(game_id)` which inserts a `host_earnings` row (`status='pending'`). Admin reviews and approves → atomic DB transaction credits `profiles.wallet_balance` (see INV-16).

---

## 7. Stream Session Flow

```
host_assignment_status = 'accepted'
   │  GET /host/games/:id/stream-session   (stream page loads)
   ▼
[optional] camera/mic/connection readiness wizard
   │  POST /host/games/:id/stream-session  (status='testing' → 'ready')
   ▼
   │  POST /host/games/:id/stream-session/live
   ▼
LiveKit token minted → host goes live
   │  POST /host/games/:id/stream-session/end
   ▼
Stream session ended
```

Guards:
- `host_assignment_status === 'pending'` → `assignment_not_accepted` (403)
- `host_id !== caller` → `not_assigned_to_this_game` (403)
- `g.status ∉ {upcoming, open, live}` → `game_not_live_able` (409)

---

## 8. Host-App UI Decision Tree (game detail page)

```
game.host_id === host.id  →  isAssigned = true
  ├─ host_assignment_status = 'pending'  →  Show: Accept / Reject
  └─ host_assignment_status = 'accepted' →  Show: Start Hosting button

game.host_id === null AND game.status = 'upcoming'  →  isAvailable = true
  └─ Show: Apply form (request to host)

otherwise  →  Read-only view
```

---

## 9. Schedule Conflict Check (INV-17)

`check_host_schedule_conflict(p_host_id, p_game_id)` — a `SECURITY DEFINER` PostgreSQL function — returns `true` if the host already has an accepted/pending assignment whose live window overlaps the target game's window (`scheduled_at + 90 min` default). Called before every assignment operation.
