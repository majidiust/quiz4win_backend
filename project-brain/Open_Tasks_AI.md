## P0 — Blockers (Must resolve before implementation begins)

- [P0] [BLOCKED] [HUMAN + A-05] **Resolve monetary-storage conflict (R-02 vs. Data Schema)** — Google Sheet "Data Schema" defines money columns as `NUMERIC(10,2)` / `NUMERIC(12,2)` (decimal dollars), but Rule R-02 mandates **integer cents**. Decision needed: (a) amend R-02 to allow `NUMERIC(12,2)` with documented rationale, OR (b) refactor migration `20260522120000_initial_schema.sql` to use `BIGINT` cents columns (`wallet_balance_cents`, `amount_cents`, `entry_fee_cents`, `prize_pool_cents`, `prize_earned_cents`, `entry_fee_paid_cents`, `bonus_amount_cents`, `reward_value_cents`, `reward_value_applied_cents`, `min_wallet_balance_cents`, `total_24h_usd_cents`, `total_deposited_cents`, `total_withdrawn_cents`, `total_prizes_won_cents`) and update `database.types.ts`. Affects: profiles, games, game_participants, transactions, withdrawals, aml_flags, referral_codes, vouchers, voucher_redemptions.

- [P0] [TODO] [HUMAN] **Define withdrawal limits** — Specify minimum withdrawal, maximum single withdrawal, and daily withdrawal limit per user. Required by INV-06 in Domain_Knowledge.md.

- [P0] [TODO] [HUMAN] **Define platform cut percentage** — Specify the percentage of prize pool retained by the platform per game. Required by INV-07 in Domain_Knowledge.md.

- [P0] [TODO] [HUMAN] **Define referral bonus amount** — Specify the credit (in cents) awarded to a referrer when a referred user completes their first paid game. Required by INV-08.

- [P0] [TODO] [HUMAN] **Define regulatory jurisdiction** — Specify the country/state jurisdiction for gambling/gaming compliance. Required before any real-money features can go live. See Domain_Knowledge.md §4.

- [P0] [TODO] [HUMAN] **Define tie-breaking rules** — Specify how ties are broken in `timed` mode (e.g., fastest correct answers, random, split prize). Required by Domain_Knowledge.md §5.

- [P0] [TODO] [HUMAN] **Choose payment gateway** — Select the payment provider for top-up and withdrawal (e.g., Stripe, Paystack, Flutterwave). Architecture depends on this choice.

- [P0] [DONE] [HUMAN] **Confirm Supabase project credentials** — Supabase credentials added to `.env` in repo root. Variable names follow the Supabase convention (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and related keys). `.env` must be in `.gitignore` — see P1 task below. — 2026-05-22

---

## P1 — Critical Implementation Tasks

- [P1] [DONE] [A-01] **Add `.gitignore` and verify `.env` is excluded** — `.gitignore` created covering `.env`, `.env.*`, `.tmp_*.py/txt/json`, Supabase temp dirs, Deno, Node, macOS artifacts. — 2026-05-22

- [P0] [TODO] [HUMAN] **🚨 R-01 VIOLATION — Delete temp scripts with embedded secrets** — `.tmp_run.py` contains a hardcoded Google service-account private key. Must be deleted before any `git add`. Run: `rm .tmp_run.py .tmp_fetch.py .tmp_read_sheet.py .tmp_sheet_result.txt`. Then verify with `git status` that no sensitive files are staged. The key should also be rotated in Google Cloud Console if there is any risk it was exposed.

- [P1] [TODO] [A-01] **Initialise Supabase project** — Run `supabase init` and create `supabase/config.toml`. Set up local development environment. Supabase URL and anon key are now available in `.env`.

- [P1] [DONE] [A-01] **Create initial DB migration** — `supabase/migrations/20260522120000_initial_schema.sql` created with all **31 tables** from the Data Schema sheet, indexes, FKs, CHECK constraints, and RLS *enabled*. RLS *policies* still pending (see P1 follow-up below). — 2026-05-22

- [P0] [DONE] [A-01] **Apply initial schema migration to remote Supabase DB** — Migration committed against project `xcvzagyszaxnnjojnlep` (eu-west-1, Postgres 17.6) via Supavisor pooler session mode. All 31 tables exist in `public` schema with RLS enabled (verified via `pg_tables`). — 2026-05-22

- [P1] [TODO] [A-01 + A-05] **Author RLS policies for all tables** — Initial migration enables RLS but defines no policies, which means all reads/writes are blocked except via service-role. Add a follow-up migration `20260522130000_rls_policies.sql` with per-table policies (e.g., `profiles`: user can SELECT/UPDATE own row; `transactions`: user can SELECT own rows, no UPDATE/DELETE per R-05; `withdrawals`: user can INSERT/SELECT own; `admin_users`: admin role only; etc.). Requires A-05 review per R-04.

- [P1] [DONE] [A-01] **Generate TypeScript database types** — `supabase/functions/_shared/database.types.ts` created with interfaces for all 30 tables plus aggregate `Database` type. — 2026-05-22

- [P1] [DONE] [A-01] **Set up Drizzle ORM** — Installed drizzle-orm + postgres (runtime), drizzle-kit + tsx (dev). Introspected live DB with `drizzle-kit pull`; artifacts in `supabase/drizzle/` (schema.ts, relations.ts). Created Deno import map `supabase/functions/deno.json`. Created shared DB client `supabase/functions/_shared/db/client.ts` and barrel `supabase/functions/_shared/db/index.ts`. Edge Functions import via `import { db, <table> } from "../_shared/db/index.ts"`. — 2026-05-22

- [P1] [DONE] [A-01] **Build `_shared/auth.ts` helper** — JWT validation utility reused by all Edge Functions (per R-03 and Coding_Standards.md §3). Pass JWT explicitly to `getUser(token)`. — 2026-05-24

- [P1] [TODO] [A-01] **Build `_shared/errors.ts` helper** — Standardised `errorResponse` and `successResponse` helpers.

- [P1] [TODO] [A-01] **Implement `game-join` Edge Function** — Atomic wallet debit + game participant insert via PostgreSQL RPC (INV-02, R-09).

- [P1] [TODO] [A-01] **Implement `wallet-topup` Edge Function** — Payment gateway webhook handler; credits wallet on successful payment.

- [P1] [TODO] [A-01] **Implement `wallet-withdraw` Edge Function** — KYC check + withdrawal initiation (INV-05, R-08). Blocked on P0 payment gateway choice.

- [P1] [TODO] [A-01] **Implement `game-result` Edge Function** — Record game outcome, calculate prize distribution (INV-07), insert `prize` transactions.

---

## P2 — Important Tasks

- [P2] [TODO] [A-01] **Implement `kyc-submit` Edge Function** — Accept KYC document upload reference; update `kyc_status` to `pending`; store metadata.

- [P2] [TODO] [A-01] **Implement `recaptcha` Edge Function improvements** — The existing function needs JWT validation added and integration tests written.

- [P2] [TODO] [A-01] **Write integration tests for all Edge Functions** — Cover happy path, auth failure, business rule violations (per Coding_Standards.md §7).

- [P2] [TODO] [A-03] **Design Realtime channel schema** — Define which Supabase Realtime channels broadcast game state updates and their payload shapes.

- [P2] [TODO] [A-05] **Review and approve all RLS policies** — Audit every table's RLS policy against domain invariants before any production deployment.

- [P2] [TODO] [A-01] **Create `seed.sql`** — Dev/test seed data for games, questions, and a test user with wallet balance.

---

## P3 — Nice-to-Have

- [P3] [TODO] [A-04] **Establish migration linting CI** — Add CI step that checks migration files follow naming conventions and include RLS policies.

- [P3] [TODO] [A-01] **Implement admin Edge Functions** — Restricted functions for game creation, question bank management, and KYC approval (admin role required).

- [P3] [TODO] [A-01] **Implement referral bonus logic** — Credit referrer on referred user's first paid game completion (INV-08). Blocked on P0 referral bonus amount.

- [P3] [PARTIAL] [A-01] **Push notification integration** — Game-start reminders (T-60/T-10/T-1) implemented in deploy/template-generator (2026-05-31). Still pending: result/withdrawal notifications.

- [P3] [TODO] [A-04] **Document all PostgreSQL RPC functions** — Add inline SQL comments to every `CREATE FUNCTION` with purpose, parameters, return type, and invariants enforced.

---

## Pending Deployment / Mobile Coordination

- [P1] [TODO] [HUMAN-MOBILE] **Fill iOS Universal Link manifest placeholders** — Edit `app/public/.well-known/apple-app-site-association` and replace `TEAMID.com.quiz4win.app` with the real Apple Team ID once provisioning is finalised. Then rebuild + redeploy: `docker compose build app && docker compose up -d app`.

- [P1] [TODO] [HUMAN-MOBILE] **Fill Android App Link manifest placeholder** — Edit `app/public/.well-known/assetlinks.json` and replace `REPLACE_WITH_SHA256_FROM_eas_credentials` with the SHA-256 cert fingerprint from `eas credentials` (Android → production). Then rebuild + redeploy as above.

- [P1] [TODO] [HUMAN-OPS] **Deploy quiz4win-app container to production host** — Pull latest, then `docker compose build app && docker compose up -d app` on the production VM. Also re-run `sudo bash deploy/nginx/setup.sh` only if the cert for `app.quiz4win.com` is not yet issued (the script is idempotent). Fixes the 502 on the recovery-link web fallback.

---

## Completed Tasks
- [P2] [DONE] [A-01] **Decrease template generator interval to 10s** — Updated `deploy/template-generator/generator.ts` `INTERVAL_MS` to 10s default. — 2026-06-08
- [P2] [DONE] [A-01] **Cap inter-question gap at 5s** — Updated `deploy/game-orchestrator/orchestrator.ts` to cap the random inter-question delay at 5000 ms (range 3000–5000 ms) instead of the previous 5000–10000 ms default. — 2026-06-08
- [P1] [DONE] [A-01] **Pre-resolved question buffer (depth 5)** — Reworked `orchestrator.ts` so `prefillQueue` buffers fully-resolved (generated + claimed + dedup-checked) questions and the inter-question hot path only pops + broadcasts, eliminating the lag between questions. Added `QUESTION_BUFFER_TARGET` env (default 5). Removed the 3 000 ms trailing pause after the final question (finalizes immediately). Docs + changelog synced. — 2026-06-08


- [P1] [DONE] [A-01] **Restore Game Orchestrator AMQP Consumer** — Fixed the crash due to missing `BufReader` and the TLS handshake issues with `amqplib` by switching to native `deno.land/x/amqp@v0.24.0` with a pinned `jsr:@std/io@0.224.9` import map. Replaced HTTP polling with robust real-time AMQP consumption. — 2026-05-31

Resolves 502 on Supabase recovery links opened in browser. — 2026-05-24
- [P1] [DONE] [A-01] **Extend Admin Panel game styling & asset uploads** — Added color pickers, gradient builder, and S3-backed asset upload (Icon/Thumbnail/Host Avatar) to Create Game dialog and Game Detail page; updated grid layout. — 2026-05-25
- [P1] [DONE] [A-01] **Fix db-maintainer Postgres version mismatch** — Updated Dockerfile to `postgres:17-alpine` to support `pg_dump` against Supabase Postgres 17. — 2026-05-25
